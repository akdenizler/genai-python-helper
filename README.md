# **GenAI Python Developer Helper**

### üöÄ **Description**
This application leverages the power of **Google's Generative AI** to assist Python developers by generating meaningful responses to their queries. Designed with simplicity and productivity in mind, the app comes with an interactive user interface built using **Streamlit**.

---

## **üåü Features**
- **Generate Python Development Help**:
  - Get concise, AI-powered responses to Python-related queries.
- **Log Queries and Responses**:
  - Saves unique queries and responses to a log file (`data_log.txt`) for easy retrieval.
- **View Logs**:
  - Displays previously saved queries and their responses.
- **Validation & Error Handling**:
  - Ensures only meaningful and unique inputs are processed.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Interactive GUI with a sidebar menu for easy navigation.
